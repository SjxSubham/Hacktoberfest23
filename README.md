## What is Hacktoberfest?
In its 9th year, Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software, organized by DigitalOcean. Throughout the month of October, we extend an invitation to open-source enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community to contribute to open-source projects. Your contributions can take various forms, including:
- Preparing and sharing your projects for collaboration
- Enhancing projects through pull requests
- Hosting events
- Mentoring others
- Directly supporting open source projects with donations
## How Does it Work?
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community! Here's how it works:
- Project maintainers opt into Hacktoberfest by adding the 'hacktoberfest' topic to their open-source projects.
- High-quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are recognized and rewarded.
- Active maintenance of repositories tagged with Hacktoberfest leads to additional rewards.

## What You Need to Participate and Complete Hacktoberfest
 - Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
 - Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
 - Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total
 - Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
 - The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2023 t-shirt.
## Pull/Merge Request Requirements
Ensure that your pull/merge requests meet the following criteria:

- Your pull/merge requests must align with Hacktoberfest guidelines.
- Repositories that violate Hacktoberfest’s values will not be considered, and pull/merge requests to those repositories will not count.
- Avoid spammy pull/merge requests.
- Your pull/merge requests should be submitted to a repository tagged with the “hacktoberfest” topic or labeled as “hacktoberfest-accepted.”
- Do not label your pull/merge requests as “invalid.”
- Ensure that your pull/merge requests are either merged, have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label, or receive an overall approving review.
- Once your pull/merge requests pass all the checks, they will be accepted for Hacktoberfest after the 7-day review period.
